      About Calvin Klein, Inc. <br />
      Calvin Klein is one of the world’s leading global fashion lifestyle
brands with a history of bold, non-conformist ideals that inform
everything we do. Founded in New York in 1968, the brand’s minimalist
and sensual aesthetic drives our approach to product design and
communication, creating a canvas that offers the possibility of
limitless self-expression. The Calvin Klein brands – CK Calvin Klein,
Calvin Klein, Calvin Klein Jeans, Calvin Klein Underwear, and Calvin
Klein Performance – are connected by the intention and purpose of
elevating everyday essentials to globally iconic status. Each of the
brands has a distinct identity and position in the retail landscape,
providing us the opportunity to market a range of universally appealing
products to domestic and international consumers with a variety of
needs. Our products are underpinned by responsible design, high-quality
construction, and the elimination of all unnecessary details. We strive
for unique and dimensional pieces that continuously wear well and remain
relevant season after season. Global retail sales of Calvin Klein
products were approximately $8.5 billion in 2021. Calvin Klein continues
to solidify its position as an innovator of emerging digital platforms
and modern marketing campaigns. PVH acquired Calvin Klein in 2003 and
continues to oversee a focused approach to growing the brand’s worldwide
relevance, presence, and long term growth.
